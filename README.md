# TCX file analizer

Draw graphs to compare TCX files.
This files contains data from Garmin, Polar or other sport tracker. 
Or from mobile phone apps like Strava, Endomondo, Nike running and many others.

I used it to compare different HR monitors [see my article](https://masterandrey.com/posts/en/heart_rates_sensor_garmin_vs_coospo_vs_scosche.html)
