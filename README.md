This files contains data from Garmin, Polar or other sport hart rate tracker. 

Or from mobile phone apps like Strava, Endomondo, Nike running, Garmin Connect and many others.

With that tool was created [Article with heart rate monitor comparison](https://sorokin.engineer/posts/en/heart_rates_sensor_garmin_vs_coospo_vs_scosche)

## Usage

```bash
    python chart.py
